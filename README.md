# Code-Quest

This repository is a collection of various JavaScript challenges aimed at improving and testing one's knowledge of the language.
It serves as a playground for practicing and refining JavaScript skills while also demonstrating the power of unit testing using
Jest, a popular testing library for JavaScript.

I'll post a **new coding challenge each week**, see below. These challenges should only take 10-30 minutes to complete, as I ain't got no time
for hour long challenges.

Here are all the challenges if you fancy having a look: [All challenges](.challenges/Challenges.md).

My attempt at each challenge can be found within [`src/weekly-challenges.test.ts`](src/weekly-challenges.test.ts)
