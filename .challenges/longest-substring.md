## Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters
![alt_text](images/js.png "image_tooltip")


In this coding challenge, you have a string where every character is an alphabet like the following.


```ts
let str = "abbbcabcdefef"
```


You have to find the length of the longest substring from the string without repeating any character. In other words, find the length of the longest substring with unique characters.

In the above string, the longest substring without repeating characters is “abcdef”. So the output will be 6. Result must be a valid alphabet sequence. \
