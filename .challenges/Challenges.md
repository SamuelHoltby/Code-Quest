# Purpose of this document

This document provides a list of coding challenges that are designed to help programmers improve their skills in JavaScript,
TypeScript, and React. Each challenge is presented as a task or problem that needs to be solved using the relevant technology, and
the level of difficulty may vary from week to week.

The challenges are designed to be completed in a relatively short amount of time, usually a few hours, and can be completed by
individuals or teams. The goal is to encourage participants to practise their coding skills on a regular basis, and to provide an
opportunity to learn from and collaborate with other developers.

The challenges may include topics such as data structures and algorithms, web development, frontend development, and software
design principles. Solutions to the challenges are usually shared at the end of the week, and participants are encouraged to
provide feedback and discuss different approaches to solving the problem.

Overall, the goal of the document is to provide a fun and engaging way for programmers to improve their coding skills and stay
up-to-date with the latest developments in JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.
