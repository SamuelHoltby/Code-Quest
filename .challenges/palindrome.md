## Palindrome
![alt_text](images/js.png "image_tooltip")


Given a string of text, print true or false indicating whether or not the text is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as "madam" or "racecar". You can also create an int palindrome. \



```ts
const palindromes = [
  "Deified",
  "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!",
  "Was it a car or a cat I saw?",
  "Madam, in Eden, I'm Adam",
  "Able was I ere I saw Elba",
  "Radar",
  "A Santa at NASA",
  "Mr. Owl ate my metal worm",
  "A Toyota's a Toyota",
  "Ma is a nun, as I am",
  "Racecar",
  "Don't nod",
  "Eva, can I see bees in a cave?",
  "Do geese see God?",
  "Level",
  "Never odd or even",
  "No lemons, no melon",
  "Rats live on no evil star",
  "Step on no pets",
  "Was it a rat I saw?"
];
```
